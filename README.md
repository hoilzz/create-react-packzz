# create-react-packzz

Build Your Own webpack+react Environment

If you use vscode, I recommend you to install the vscode extension(prettier, eslint).

## In this boilerplate

you can use the important features of webpack.
- code split for prevent duplication and dynamic import
- Use cache static resource(js, css) when the contents are changed 
- Increase development productivity
  - hot module replacement + react hot loader
- scss compile to minified css
- ES6+ and react can be transpiled and used using babel.
- make code beautiful by using ESLint and Prettier.

## Getting Started

```
$ npx install create-react-packzz
$ cd ${projectName}
$ npm start
```
